[Mk48.io](https://mk48.io) is an online multiplayer naval combat game, in which you take command of a ship and sail your way to victory. Watch out for torpedoes!

## Building

### Tools

0. Install `rustup` ([see instructions here](https://rustup.rs/))
1. Install Rust Nightly (`rustup override set nightly-2022-08-14`)
2. Add WebAssembly target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
3. Install `trunk` (`cargo install --locked trunk`, install `gcc` first if it complains about missing `cc`)
4. Optionally, install the `make` command

You may use any version of Rust that works, but only `nightly-2022-08-14` is known
to be compatible.

### Client

0. Enter `/client`
1. `make` or, equivalently, `trunk build --release`
2. Deploy the server to host the client

### Server

0. Enter `/server`
1. `make` to build and run a test server
2. Navigate to `localhost:8081` (or whatever port is printed in the console)

## Developing

If you follow the *Building* steps, you have a fully functioning game (could be used to host a private server). If your goal
is to modify the game, you may want to read more :)

### Entity data

Entities (ships, weapons, aircraft, collectibles, obstacles, decoys, etc.) are defined at the bottom of
`common/src/entity/_type.rs`.

### Entity textures

Each entity type must be accompanied by a texture of the same name in the spritesheet, which comes with the
repository. If entity textures need to be changed, see instructions in the `sprite_sheet_packer` directory.

### Engine

Both client and server rely on our custom game engine (which is present in the `engine` directory).

#### Admin interface (optional)
One notable feature of the engine is an (optional) admin interface. To build it:

0. Install NodeJS 14 or higher ([here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
1. Enter `/engine/js`
2. `make`
3. Deploy the server to host the admin interface
4. Go to `localhost:8081/admin/`
5. Paste the contents of `engine/game_server/src/auth.txt`, generated randomly by a build script, into the alert dialog

### Macros

Many macros are utilized by the codebase. Mk48-specific macros can be found in the `macros` directory,
and game engine macros can be found in the `engine/engine_macros` directory. A few notable macros are:
- Mk48 entity loader (generates `EntityData` for all entity types, used by both client and server)
- Game engine audio loader (generates `Audio` enum for client, with a variant per sound)
- Game engine settings (generates Javascript bindings for settings structs)
- Game engine renderer layer (for composable rendering layers)
