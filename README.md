## Developing

If you follow the *Building* steps, you have a fully functioning game (could be used to host a private server). If your goal
is to modify the game, you may want to read more :)

### Entity data

Entities (ships, weapons, aircraft, collectibles, obstacles, decoys, etc.) are defined at the bottom of
`common/src/entity/_type.rs`.

### Entity textures

Each entity type must be accompanied by a texture of the same name in the spritesheet, which comes with the
repository. If entity textures need to be changed, see instructions in the `sprite_sheet_packer` directory.
